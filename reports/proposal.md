# Synth
### Team Members: Diego Berny, Emma Pan, Manu Patil

## GOAL
Our team wishes to learn more about how C interacts with hardware using arduino microcontrollers. <br>
Lower Bound: Make a sound <br>
Upper Bound: Play a song

## Learning Goals
Diego: Become more proficient with C and learn how it interfaces with hardware <br>
Emma: Become more comfortale with C and learn how to make noises with an Arduino <br>
Manu: Learn more about about C through especially when it comes to Arduino programming. 

# What we need
We are following the instructions for the previous SoftSysSynth. We have already acquired the materials for this project.

# Tasks
Create a schematic in kicad of the electrical diagram - Manu <br>
Looking through other relavent code - All <br>
Research and find relavent documentation for arduino and the the circuit -Emma <br>
Figure out different effects to implement - Diego <br>
