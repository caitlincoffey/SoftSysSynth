# Synth
### Team Members: Diego Berny, Emma Pan, Manu Patil

## GOAL
Our team wishes to learn more about how C interacts with hardware using arduino microcontrollers. <br>
**Lower Bound**: Play a song <br>
**Upper Bound**: Play ANY song, given a midi file <br>

___

## Learning Goals
**Diego**: Become more proficient with C and learn how it interfaces with hardware <br>
**Emma**: Become more comfortale with C and learn how to make noises with an Arduino <br>
**Manu**: Learn more about about C through especially when it comes to Arduino programming. <br>

___

## What we need
We are following the instructions for the previous SoftSysSynth. We have already acquired the materials for this project. <br>

___

## Tasks
* Create a script for converting midi to csv files 
* Rewire circuit to have 6 buttons
* Figure out how to read from csv in Arduino
* Create documentation for progress
* Clean up code
